## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Course Projects - Hebrew University**

This repository contains multiple projects developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem**.  
Each project demonstrates different OOP concepts, including **encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and design patterns**.

### **Projects Overview:**

1. **Tic Tac Toe Tournament**  
   - Implementation of a **Tic Tac Toe** game where different AI strategies compete.  
   - Uses **interfaces and strategy design patterns** to allow multiple playing strategies, including a **clever** and **genius** player.  

2. **BrickBreaker** *(Uses DanoGameLab 1.1.0 - 17.10.23)*  
   - A modern take on the classic **Breakout** game where players break bricks using a bouncing ball and paddle.  
   - Includes **special power-ups** and **unique brick behaviors** to enhance gameplay.  
   - Built using the **DanoGameLab 1.1.0 (17.10.23) library** for game mechanics and rendering.  

3. **ASCII Art Generator**  
   - A program that converts images into **ASCII art**.  
   - Supports different **resolution levels**, **custom character sets**, and **HTML or console output**.  

4. **Flora Game (Observer Pattern Implementation)** *(Uses DanoGameLab 1.1.0 - 17.10.23)*  
   - A game featuring interactive objects like **logs, leaves, and fruits** that react dynamically to the player's actions.  
   - Implements the **Observer pattern**, where game objects respond to changes in the playerâ€™s state.  
   - Uses the **Factory Method pattern** to generate game elements dynamically.  
   - Built using the **DanoGameLab 1.1.0 (17.10.23) library** for game mechanics and rendering.  

Each project in this repository showcases different **OOP principles** and **design patterns**, demonstrating structured software development.
