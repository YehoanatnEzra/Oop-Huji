# **Bricker**

BrickBreaker is a modern twist on the classic arcade game *Breakout*, where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.  
Each brick in the game features a unique collision strategy.  
The player starts with 3 lives and loses one if the ball falls below the paddle.  
If all lives are lost, the game is over.  

## **Game Rules**  
- The player starts with three lives, a main ball, and a paddle.  
- Use the paddle to bounce the ball and break bricks.  
- Move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.  
- A life is lost when the ball falls below the paddle.  
- Extra lives can be earned by destroying bricks with a heart strategy and catching the falling hearts with the paddle.  

### **Special Effects from Bricks:**  
- Adding an extra paddle.  
- Focusing the camera on the ball.  
- Spawning two additional puck balls.  

The game is completed when all bricks are destroyed without losing all lives.
