# ASCII Art Generator

This project is an implementation of an algorithm that converts images into ASCII art.
The program processes an image, calculates its brightness, and maps it to characters based on the brightness levels.
It supports output in both the console and HTML formats, and it allows the user to interact with the application via a command-line interface.

## Commands
The program accepts the following commands via the command-line interface:

- **image <path_to_image>**: Sets the image for ASCII art generation.
- **output html**: Outputs the ASCII art to an HTML file.
- **output console**: Outputs the ASCII art to the console.
- **chars**: Displays the current character set used for mapping image brightness.
- **add <character>**: Adds a character to the character set.
- **remove <character>**: Removes a character from the character set.
- **res up**: Increases the resolution.
- **res down**: Decreases the resolution.
- **asciiArt**: Generates and displays the ASCII art based on the current settings.
- **exit**: Exits the program.

## Installation and Usage
- Clone the repository (if not already done).
- Navigate to the Bricker project.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run ascii_art.Shell.
- Use the command-line above to interact with the program and generate ASCII art from your images.
