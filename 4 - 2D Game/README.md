# 2D Game
This project is a simulation of a dynamic game world, where objects such as logs, leaves, and fruits interact with the player's avatar. The environment reacts to the avatarâ€™s actions, implementing key design patterns to manage behaviors and interactions efficiently.

## **Installation & running**
- Clone the repository (if not already done).
- Navigate to the Bricker project.
- This project requires an external library, so download DanoGameLab 1.1.0 - 17.10.23 (https://danthe1st.itch.io/danogamelab).
- Run pepse.PepseGameManager.

## Classes and Design Patterns
**Log Class:**
- Role: Represents a log in the game world that changes color based on
the state of the avatar.
- Design Pattern: Observer pattern is indirectly used here.
The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject, and the Log class
observes changes in the avatar's state to adjust its color accordingly.

**Leaf Class:**
- Role: Represents a leaf object in the game world with
animations triggered by the avatar's state.
- Design Pattern: Observer pattern is used here as well. The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject, and the Leaf class observes changes in the avatar's state to trigger animations.

**Fruit Class:**
- Role: Represents a fruit object in the game world that changes color based
on the avatar's
state and triggers actions when eaten.
- Design Pattern: Observer pattern is again used here.
The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject, and the Fruit class
observes changes in the
avatar's state to change its color.

**Flora Class**
- Role: Represents the flora in the game world and generates trees, logs, leaves,
and fruits within a specified range.
Overall Design Patterns:
- Observer Pattern: Used in Log, Leaf, and Fruit classes to observe changes in the avatar's
state and trigger actions/animations accordingly.
Factory Method Pattern: Used in Flora class with the createInRange method serving as a
factory method to create different types of game objects within a specified range.
These classes and their interactions demonstrate a structured
approach to modeling elements
in a game world while utilizing common design patterns to manage
behaviors and relationships
effectively.
