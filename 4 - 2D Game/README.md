# 2D Game
This project is a simulation of a dynamic game world, where objects such as logs, leaves, and fruits interact with the player's avatar. The environment reacts to the avatarâ€™s actions, implementing key design patterns to manage behaviors and interactions efficiently.

## **Installation & running**
- Clone the repository (if not already done).
- Navigate to the Bricker project.
- This project requires an external library, so download DanoGameLab 1.1.0 - 17.10.23 (https://danthe1st.itch.io/danogamelab).
- Run pepse.PepseGameManager.

## Classes and Design Patterns
Log Class:
Role: Represents a log in the game world that changes color based on
the state of the avatar.
Design Pattern: Observer pattern is indirectly used here.
The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject, and the Log class
observes changes in the avatar's
state to adjust its color accordingly.

Leaf Class:
Role: Represents a leaf object in the game world with
animations triggered by the avatar's state.
Design Pattern: Observer pattern is used here as well.
The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject,
and the Leaf class observes changes in
the avatar's state to trigger animations.

Fruit Class:
Role: Represents a fruit object in the game world that changes color based
on the avatar's
state and triggers actions when eaten.
Design Pattern: Observer pattern is again used here.
The BooleanSupplier (avatarState) acts as the subject, and the Fruit class
observes changes in the
avatar's state to change its color.

Flora Class
Role: Represents the flora in the game world and generates trees, logs, leaves,
and fruits within a specified range.
Overall Design Patterns:
Observer Pattern: Used in Log, Leaf, and Fruit classes to observe changes in the avatar's
state and trigger actions/animations accordingly.
Factory Method Pattern: Used in Flora class with the createInRange method serving as a
factory method to create different types of game objects within a specified range.
These classes and their interactions demonstrate a structured
approach to modeling elements
in a game world while utilizing common design patterns to manage
behaviors and relationships
effectively.

Connection between the classes:
The connections between all the classes are primarily established through their
interactions within the game world and their inheritance relationships:
Log, Leaf, and Fruit classes all extend the GameObject class,
indicating that they are specialized game objects within the game world.
Log class extends Block, specifying that it's a type of block in the game world.
Rendering Components:
Log, Leaf, and Fruit classes all utilize different renderable components
(RectangleRenderable for Log and Leaf, and OvalRenderable for Fruit)
to visualize their representation within the game world.
Behavioral Interactions:
Log, Leaf, and Fruit classes all respond to changes in the avatar's state
(BooleanSupplier avatarState). They observe the avatar's state to
trigger color changes,
animations, or actions.
Flora Class:
Flora class serves as a manager or orchestrator for generating various game
objects (Log, Leaf, Fruit) within the game world.
Flora class interacts with GameObjectCollection, Vector2,
Function<Float, Float>, and Runnable instances,
 providing necessary callbacks and dependencies for creating game objects.
Overall, the connections between all the classes facilitate the construction of a
dynamic game world where objects interact with each other and respond to changes
in the game environment or player actions. The inheritance, rendering components,
behavioral interactions, and management provided by the Flora class ensure a cohesive
and organized structure within the game world.
